<br />

This Penpot design file shows what the component should look like.
You will have to create a free account to view it.

The design file is also available as a PDF in the project's root "Puzzle 1 Design File".

<b>It does not have to be perfect, but it does have to look something like that design!</b>


### 4 - Unit Tests

Write a unit test for the Newspaper component

src/components/
 - Newspaper.test.js

It must check that:
- The Newspaper Header Image Exists
- The Story Headline Exists
- The Story Image Exists
- The Story Text Exists

Hint:

Look at the unit tests for the not-found page and the header component, they contain very similar code to what you need to write!
You will have to declare any sub-components that component displays and import any modules it uses.

Unit tests are hard for beginners, so watch my solution for help. Then try it yourself!


### Images

Check the public/images folder for the images you will need for this puzzle.


### Use this text as the news story:

Headline: 

Safety Meeting Ends In Accident

Story:

The day started with a safety meeting, that wouldn't stay safe for long! At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Gary Black was in a hurry to arrive at the meeting room and accidentally slipped on a banana.
Gary reportedly wobbled like a tipsy giraffe, and was sent sprawling into several nearby pot plants.

# Good Luck!
